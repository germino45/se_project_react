# Project 4: WTWR.

### Overview

- Intro

- Improve

**Intro**

This is the sixth project of the Software Engineer program at Practicum. It was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and React.JS based on the Figma design. Currently, this filters out a preset number of clothing that determines what you should wear depending on the weather.

**Improve**

Currently, I am working on the functionality for the user to add more clothing based on the weather type the user chooses and filtering the Weather Card to change based on the weather time of day. This will come out with the next update. A future update will also include a responsive design that will change based on the screen size of the user's device.
