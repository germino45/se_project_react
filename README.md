# Project 4: WTWR.

### Overview

**Intro**

This is the sixth project of the Software Engineer program at Practicum. It was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and React.JS based on the Figma design. Currently, this filters out a preset number of clothing from the db.json file and allows the user to add cards to the file using the app. The app also determines what you should wear depending on the weather. Users can switch between Farenheit and Celcius temperatures, navigate to the profile where users can see all the clothes/cards and navigate to a 404 Not Found page.

**Improve**

Currently, I am working on the functionality for filtering the Weather Card to change based on the weather at the time of day. This will come out with the next update. I will also add the ability for users to be able to download the app and use all the functionality soon. A future update will also include a responsive design that will change based on the screen size of the user's device, form validity and more!
